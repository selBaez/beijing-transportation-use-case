one file for preprocessing

one file per model				load data
	tree					          predict-classify (forward pass)
	mlp					            train or error correct (backward pass)
	bayesian                save assembled model
												  test
													evaluation metrics

one file for prediction   load trained model
													forward pass
													save predictions

one file for feature engineering        load data
																				create CNN
																				apply CNN
																				visualize features
																				save features

one file for correlation test			load data
																	apply correlation tests
																	select columns based on significance
																	save only needed


MAJOR PROBLEM: only 908 labeled records
			K-fold with replacement

TODO:
recalculate path link (if necessary)
array of card codes corresponding to labeled data
sample algorithms on given data
plot area distribution
chi test
normalize areas?


Papers to get:
Reconstructing individual mobility from smart card transactions: a collaborative space alignment approach


Improvements to report:
transfer time focus on TRANSFER_DETAIL
pie chart for number of transfers
thesis organization more technical, and methods per parts
data flow chart for parts of study
Mention hierarchy in traffic areas will cause correlation
comment on ordinal structure vs one hot

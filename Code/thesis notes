TODO:
normalize areas? keep as ordinal?
num of transfer as pie chart

sample algorithms on given data
ensemble

silhouettes samples for cluster membership



Papers to get:
Reconstructing individual mobility from smart card transactions: a collaborative space alignment approach


Improvements to report:
transfer time focus on tail
thesis organization more technical, and methods per parts
Mention hierarchy in traffic areas will cause correlation
Attributes summary: numerical vs categorical
Section: deal with categorical -> tokenize, encode, bins
comment on ordinal structure vs one hot
random forests deal well with categorical (large node size), adaboost with missing info

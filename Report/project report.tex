\title{Commuter classification: Beijing use case}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two
% commands used to separate the names and addresses of multiple
% authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.

\section{Task 1}
Should contain information about the current task and some description of the MLP model and TensorFlow framework.
Put the answers for the questions from the Task 1 into this section.

\section{Task 2}
Should contain your study of the default model from the Task 2.

\section{Task 3}
Should contain results of your experiments.
Please, describe all experiments settings to make the report self-contained without this file.
Put each experiment in separate subsection.

\subsection{Experiment-1: Weight initialization}
\subsection{Experiment-2: Interaction between initialization and activation}
\subsection{Experiment-3: Architecture}
\subsection{Experiment-4: Optimizers}
\subsection{Experiment-5: Be creative}

\section{Conclusion}
Should contain conclusion of this study.
For example, you can try to answer the following questions.
What was done during this assignment? What features of TensorBoard were positive and what were negative for implementing MLP model and performing the experiments?
What are the main insights you got from the study of the MLP model on CIFAR10 dataset?
